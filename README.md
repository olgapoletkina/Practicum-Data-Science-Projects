**Practicum Data Science Projects**

This repository is a curated collection of Jupyter notebooks representing the projects I developed during the Practicum Data Science course. Each project is encapsulated in its own notebook, demonstrating practical applications of data science and machine learning techniques across different domains.

**Projects Overview**

**Cars Price Prediction:** Utilizing regression models to predict car prices based on various attributes.
**Customer Churn Prediction for a Bank:** Implementing classification algorithms to identify potential customer churn in a banking context.
**Customer Churn Prediction for a Telecom:** A similar analysis focused on churn within the telecommunications sector.
**Gold Recovery Rate from Ore:** Applying unsupervised learning techniques to optimize the gold recovery process.
**Oil Field Risk Prediction:** Risk assessment in oil field exploration using probabilistic models.
**Real Estate Analysis:** Market analysis and price prediction for real estate investments.
**Taxi Demand Prediction:** Forecasting taxi demand in urban areas using time series analysis.
**Toxic Text Identification:** Natural Language Processing (NLP) to identify and filter toxic comments.
**Trends for Computer Games:** Analysis of trends in computer game popularity and sales.
Each notebook is complete with data exploration, preprocessing, model building, evaluation, and a discussion of results. The datasets directory contains all the data used for these analyses.
